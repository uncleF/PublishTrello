(typically) some javascript will load an image when it comes into the browser's viewport instead of loading all images at page load.\n- Prioritizing visible content (or above the fold rendering) where you include only the minimum css/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the user's browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred

The engine evaluates each rule from right to left, starting from the rightmost selector (called the \"key\") and moving through each selector until it finds a match or discards the rule.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"idBoard":"55d31ef1e9e2a72a7d048977","idList":"55d31f04cc3ef97358c96360","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":61,"idAttachmentCover":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"idLabels":["55d31ef119ad3a5dc22419b9"],"name":"Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.","pos":1310719,"shortLink":"4p2QxlZO","badges":{"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null},"due":null,"email":"ilja25+54d089d9197f0bba2b59598d+55d32822d9f91a171f357f11+0b416e4fff1a1aa7b5fef9d6c2802fa1529b852a@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[{"id":"55d31ef119ad3a5dc22419b9","idBoard":"55d31ef1e9e2a72a7d048977","name":"Answer","color":"green","uses":106}],"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/4p2QxlZO","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/4p2QxlZO/61-explain-how-a-browser-determines-what-elements-match-a-css-selector","attachments":[]},{"id":"56541ce7e3581a55e5a3b485","checkItemStates":[],"closed":false,"dateLastActivity":"2015-12-27T10:24:01.108Z","desc":"#### Answer\n\nJust like pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements are added to selectors but instead of describing a special state, they allow you to style certain parts of a document.

Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype.

JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object.

These can be combined in many ways, and can replace most loops in a program.\n\n##### Cons:\n\n- allocating lots and lots of small objects rather than modifying ones you already have can have a performance impact. Usually the complexity of either the allocator or the garbage collector depends on the number of objects on the heap.\n- cyclic data structures such as graphs are difficult to build.

These can be combined in many ways, and can replace most loops in a program.\n\nCONS:\n---\n\n- allocating lots and lots of small objects rather than modifying ones you already have can have a performance impact. Usually the complexity of either the allocator or the garbage collector depends on the number of objects on the heap.\n\n- cyclic data structures such as graphs are difficult to build.
